# Qiskit Fall Fest 2024

## Welcome
Welcome to the Qiskit Fall Fest event at the University of Washington. We're so excited to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the [Husky Quantum Computing Club](https://qiskit.org). If you're interested in learning more about quantum computing and staying engaged with the quantum community on campus, consider joining our RSO!
The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum. Student leaders work alongside IBM to design and plan their event, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here at the University of Washington is going to be a combination of quantum computing workshops and a hackathon. The events will start from October 8th (TENTATIVE) and run through October 18th (TENTATIVE). Details about the events and rules can be found below.
